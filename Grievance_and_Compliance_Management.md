Nodal contact person: Samrat Dutta

Send your Grievances to CoWiseCare@gmail.com

Send your complaints to CoWiseCare@gmail.com

CoWiseCare is a small platform created by Samrat Dutta. It is still a voluntery service and Samrat Dutta makes no money from it. So, he can not afford to hire experts to manage grievances, compliances and complaints. 
Samrat Dutta manages everything single handedly, so mistakes might happen. It is a request to the lawmakers and the protectors of the law to judge everything with kindness in case any guideline is violated.

Being just a student, I, Samrat Dutta, don't even know how to write these documents properly. Please judge mistakes with kindness and forgiveness. I made this platform to help others in need and I shall try to ensure the laws and guidelines are followed properly. 
Please write to CoWiseCare@gmail.com if you have any complaint. 
Thanks.
